# Mateus Panunci
I am in the 2nd year of Data Science and Artificial Intelligence at the State University of Londrina - UEL ðŸ“—. 

I started studying IT because I have always been passionate about video games since I was a child, when my first console was a PS2, and later, a PS4 ðŸŽ®; in addition, I have always enjoyed studying mathematics and learning about technology in general.
